```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(brolgar)
```


To create your own features or summaries to pass to `feasts`, you can provide a named list of functions. For example:

```{r create-three}
library(feasts)
feat_three <- list(min = min,
                   med = median,
                   max = max)

feat_three

```

These are then passed to `features` like so:

```{r demo-feat-three}
wages_ts %>%
  features(ln_wages, feat_three)

world_heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_three)
```
