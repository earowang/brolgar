\title{Wages data from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY)}
\format{A \code{tsibble} data frame with 6402 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{id}{1â€“888, for each subject. This forms the \code{key} of the data}
\item{ln_wages}{natural log of wages, adjusted for inflation,
to 1990 dollars.}
\item{xp}{Experience - the length of time in the workforce (in years).
This is treated as the time variable, with t0 for each subject starting
on their first day at work. The number of time points and values of time
points for each subject can differ. This forms the \code{index} of the data}
\item{ged}{when/if a graduate equivalency diploma is obtained.}
\item{xp_since_ged}{change in experience since getting a ged (if they get one)}
\item{black}{categorical indicator of race = black.}
\item{hispanic}{categorical indicator of race = hispanic.}
\item{high_grade}{highest grade completed}
\item{unemploy_rate}{unemployment rates in the local geographic region
at each measurement time}

\description{
This data contains measurements on hourly wages by years in
the workforce, with education and race as covariates. The population
measured was male high-school dropouts, aged between 14 and 17 years
